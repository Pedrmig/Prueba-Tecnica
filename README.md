# Technical Assessment Example

This is an example of a technical assessment used by insurance companies or other enterprises. The dataset provided contains fictitious data.

## Starting Point

First, you will be provided with three datasets:

1. **Historical Payment Data**: Contains historical payment (or non-payment) information of insurance premiums contracted with an insurance company for a set of IDs. This information is presented in historical series ranging from 1 to 60 months.
2. **Qualitative Information**: Contains qualitative information for a series of IDs.
3. **Address Information**: Contains the full address, postal code, and state within the United States.

## The Challenge

Using the aforementioned data, can you determine which new clients can be offered a free premium installment?

You should assume that the same qualitative information available in the challenge's dataset will be available for these new clients.

Below, we will explain the various resources at your disposal, as well as the challenge you will face.

## Approach to Case Resolution

### Understanding the Problem and Dataset
You are presented with a problem to solve. To do this, you have a dataset that will assist you in the resolution.

### Data Treatment and Cleansing Process
In this second step, you will need to prepare the data to apply the chosen model. This includes cleaning erroneous data, handling outliers, changing formats, merging tables, and addressing other issues that could cause model failures.

### Data Analysis and Visualization Process
In this process, a presentation of the preliminary data analysis, initial conclusions from the dataset, as well as a visualization of the different variables that provide context to how the problem will be approached, will be required.

### Data Modeling and Analysis Process
In this step, a model will be applied to the dataset to either classify the data to solve the problem or predict future events to be analyzed.

### Obtaining Results, Visualization, and Conclusions
After executing the model and obtaining results, you should derive conclusions, answers to the problem, and visualizations of the results, as well as the message to be conveyed.
